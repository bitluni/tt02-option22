# TinyTapeout project information
# project:
#   wokwi_id:    # If using wokwi, set this to your project's ID
source_files:        # If using an HDL, set wokwi_id as 0 and uncomment and list your source files here. Source files must be in ./src
     - top.v
#    - decoder.v
  top_module:  "option22"      # put the name of your top module here, make it unique by prepending your github username

# As everyone will have access to all designs, try to make it easy for someone new to your design to know what
# it does and how to operate it.
#
# Here is an example: https://github.com/mattvenn/tinytapeout_m_segments/blob/main/info.yaml
#
# This info will be automatically collected and used to make a datasheet for the chip.

  description:  "Looong shift register for POV displays"      # Short description of what your project does
  how_it_works: "write=high: Data is shifted in on clock positive edge. Each full 8 bits will be staged to output. It will rotate rough all words with the clock. Reset only resets internal counter for the byte index."      # Longer description of how the project works
  how_to_test:  "Keep write high and push data in with clock mayby as button."      # Instructions on how someone could test your project, include things like what buttons do what and how to set the clock if needed
  external_hw:  "Pink LEDs"      # Describe any external hardware needed
  language:     "Verilog" # other examples include Verilog, Amaranth, VHDL, etc

  clock_hz:     0       # Clock frequency in Hz (if required) we are expecting max clock frequency to be ~6khz. Provided on input 0.
